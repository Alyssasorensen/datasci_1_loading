Vaccine Immunogenicity Study,A Multicenter Trial Evaluating Alterative Dosing Strategies of the JYNNEOS MVA-BN mpox Vaccine,Vaccine,NIH/NIAID,Domestic,Active enrolling (started 9/9/2022),2023 Q1: Initial immunogenicity analysis (peak response),2023 Q2,"This study is a Phase 2 randomized, open-label, non-placebo controlled, multi-site clinical trial that will evaluate two intradermal (ID) regimens for MVA-BN vaccine compared to the standard subcutaneous (SC) regimen in healthy, vaccinia-naïve adults 18 to 50 years of age, inclusive. This study will provide more information on the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of intradermal dosing and may enable the US and the world to further stretch supplies of Jynneos vaccine to address the current and future MPX outbreak, as well as a potential smallpox attack.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05512949?cond=Monkeypox&fund=01&draw=2

Drug-Vaccine Interaction Study,Study to evaluate the immunogenicity profile and potential immunological interference of JYNNEOS while concomitantly administering TPOXX for 28 days,Vaccine,DoD/JPM CBRN Medical,USA,Ongoing,FY2023 Q3: Completion of Database Lock,2023-10-31T00:00:00.000,"This study is a Phase 2, randomized, open-label (JYNNEOS), double-blind (TPOXX and placebo), placebo-controlled, multicenter drug vaccine interaction study to examine whether administering TPOXX with JYNNEOS concomitantly affects JYNNEOS immunogenicity in healthy adult subjects. A total of 100 subjects (50 per treatment group), ages 18 to 42, inclusive, will be enrolled and randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups. Understanding that both JYNNEOS and TPOXX can be administered safely in healthy adult subjects will help support the CDC EAP for orthopoxvirus treatment.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04957485
Vaccine Effectiveness Study,National estimates of post-licensure vaccine performance and effectiveness,Vaccine,CDC,Domestic,Planned,"2022 Q3: begin project data collection

2023 Q1: complete data collection and analysis",2023 Q2: multi-jurisdictional case-control study,"CDC will: 1) Collect data from states and local jurisdictions on the vaccination status of diagnosed mpox cases to determine real-world vaccine performance.  Incidence of these post-vaccination cases will be calculated and used to prospectively update trends. This analysis will be a rapid evaluation of whether the vaccine has been successful in preventing infection and/or attenuating the course of illness. 2) Conduct a multi-jurisdictional case control study to produce vaccine effectiveness estimates on several strata, including dose, route of administration, and other factors. 3) Assist other jurisdictions on their own case---control studies, including those planned in California, NYC, and the Veteran’s Administration.

These efforts will contribute to a robust understanding of the contribution of vaccination to halting transmission and will provide insights into the long-term efficacy of novel, dose-sparing routes of administration.",
Vaccine Effectiveness Case Series Evaluation,Post-vaccination case series,Vaccine,CDC,Domestic,Planned,2022 Q3: project will begin data collection,Completed 2022 Q4,"This is a post-vaccination case series to collect additional data points from post-vaccination cases and assess factors associated with becoming infected with mpox following vaccination. This study will provide timely information about the effectiveness of vaccination to decrease the spread of virus within the population most affected and will highlight circumstances associated with breakthrough infections.

Vaccine Utilization Study,Evaluating vaccine administration data,Vaccine,CDC,Domestic,Ongoing; data analyzed weekly,2022 Q3: project will begin data collection,Ongoing throughout vaccination,Vaccine administration data is being collected from states and selected local jurisdictions and territories via CDC’s Immunization Data Lake (IZDL)system and analyzed and updated weekly. This study will provide insights into the equitable distribution and population coverage of vaccines that have been distributed by the federal government to protect individuals from infection and prevent ongoing virus transmission. High level data on mpox vaccine coverage (one and two doses) among at-risk population were shared with each jurisdiction and with CDC and WH leadership in December 2022; discussion ongoing regarding goals/expectations of optimal coverage among at-risk population.,
Vaccine Safety Surveillance,Monitoring safety and adverse events,Vaccine,CDC,Domestic,Ongoing (VAERS and VSD),2022 Q4: v-safe will begin data collection,Ongoing throughout vaccination,"Efforts include spontaneous reporting to Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS); healthcare-based surveillance in Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD); and voluntary surveys using v-safe. This study will provide vital information to ensure that there are no unintended harms from the vaccines administered during this outbreak, which are intended to protect individuals from infection and prevent ongoing virus transmission.",https://vaers.hhs.gov/
Vaccine Immunogenicity Study,Evaluating immune response to JYNNEOS vaccine,Vaccine,CDC,Domestic,Ongoing; Laboratory work is ongoing. Enrollment for 6-7 month timepoint has begun,"2023 Q1-Q2:
Publish results",2023 Q2,"Conducted in collaboration with DC Health, CDC is evaluating the immune response to JYNNEOS vaccine among persons at elevated risk of MPX exposure. Serologic immune response is being assessed at days 0, 28, and 42–56 after single dose of JYNNEOS vaccination. Participants are also being enrolled for a 6-7 month timepoint, to determine the longevity of antibody response, with additional 1, 1.5 and 2 year time points are also planned in future. This study will provide vital information to ensure that the vaccines administered during this outbreak are effective (immunogenic) and generate a uniform, rapid immunologic response among people of different ages and background health status. The study samples from first 3 time points are partially completed. Neutralization titers determination is in progress, and the study is being drafted for publication.",
